# Nimoh World Generation Plugin

A custom Minecraft world generation plugin developed for the **Nimohia** server, focused on creating dynamic and immersive terrain using noise-based generation techniques. This plugin is no longer in active development and the repository is being archived.

## Features

* **Procedural Terrain Generation:**

  * Simplex-based noise terrain
  * Warped noise paths
  * Custom pathfinding logic for natural trail creation

* **Block Populators:**

  * Tree generation with inter-chunk support
  * Trapdoor placement logic
  * Dynamic path width and terrain blending

* **Biome and Material Control:**

  * Full control over material placement per noise value
  * Smooth transitions for path features and decorations

* **Optimized for Paper/Spigot API**

## Usage

This plugin was tailored for the Nimoh server and isn't intended as a general-purpose world generator. However, you can:

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile it with Gradle or your preferred build tool
3. Place the resulting JAR in your Paper/Spigot server's `plugins` folder

## Notes

* Some features like path branching or biome assignment were experimental.
* Integration with other plugins (e.g. Essentials, LuckPerms) was server-specific.
* Plugin was developed in Kotlin and follows idiomatic structure.

## Archived

As of July 2025, this repository is archived. No further updates or support will be provided.
